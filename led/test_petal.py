# Test that the 4 leads on each petal are connected to the proper
# leads on a FadeCandy.  Granularity is only even petal/odd petal.
# if you need to check that the correct petal is connected to the correct
#	FC you are on your own.

#	when you look at the flat side of a FadeCandy the letters are at the top
#	and the 0 connector is at the lower left.

# Standalone code completely isolated from our environment, only depends on
# finding a copy of opc.py in the current directory and having a running
# fcserver whose config JSON sees all the fadecandy IDs.
# Sample usage:
# $ sudo fcserver ~/etc/fcserver.json &
# $ ./test_petal.py
